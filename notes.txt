Future Features
---------------

If track title is longer than 60 characters --> reduce font size
  .artist-stat-title {
    font-size: 30px;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
  }


-------------------

Add button to `Create your personalized Top 20 Playlist`
  - maybe only allow for tracks?
  - would be interesting to do for artists if there was a way to query for top 3 or 5 tracks for a given artist

  ** need to add `playlist-modify-public` to permission scopes on login

  - creates a new playist called `Top 20`
    - maybe append a date?
    - could also query to see if that exists ( if possible, although it might require querying for all a users playlists, checking names to see if playlist.name === 'Top 20' but that could be too flimsy )

    example POST request:
      - url = https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{user_id}/playlists
      - body = { name: "Top 20" }
      - response has playlist_id for following request

  - make POST request to add 20 tracks to playlist
    - will need to ensure tracks are added to `uris` array in order

    example POST request:
    - url = https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{user_id}/playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks
    - body =  {
                "uris": [
                  "spotify:track:4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh",
                  "spotify:track:1301WleyT98MSxVHPZCA6M"
                ]
              }
    - track uri's should be saved to an array / variable upon initial query so this is ready to go / to lower request count

  - create a custom image so that the playlists look real official

Add option to share on social media?
  - at least give the ability to copy the playlist link
  - maybe give the embed code?
  - could even have it generated and appended to page or in a modal for visual confirmation / then you can use already existing share options ( if thats a thing )

this is the html for an embedded playlist widget:
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed?{ playlist-uri }" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

example playlist uri
  spotify:user:121235432:playlist:1N2DAmpJNtj33gyyLYUAot

  requires logged in users ID and playlist URI / ID
